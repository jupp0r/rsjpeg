# rsjpeg

This is a toy project implementing a jpeg decoder in safe Rust.
Eventually, the goal is to provide a libjpeg ABI compatible decoder for
applications where security outweighs performance.

## Status

This project is in its infancy. It does not successfully decode JPEG yet.

*DO NOT USE THIS IN PRODUCTION*
